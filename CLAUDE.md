# MFE Monorepo Setup Instructions for Claude Code

## Project Overview
This is a monorepo using pnpm workspaces for a microfrontend (MFE) architecture with a container app that dynamically loads MFEs. The container app shares React 19, Redux Toolkit, TailwindCSS, and ShadCN components with MFEs to reduce bundle sizes.

## ✅ Implementation Status
The monorepo has been successfully created with all requested features implemented and working.

## Technology Stack
- **Package Manager**: pnpm with workspaces
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Testing**: Vitest
- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS, ShadCN UI components
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with React-Redux
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **Module Federation**: Custom MFE loading system

## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 18
- pnpm >= 8 (will be installed automatically if not present)

### Installation & Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build all packages (required first time)
pnpm -r build

# Start all apps in parallel
pnpm dev

# Or start individual apps
pnpm dev:container   # Container app on http://localhost:3000
pnpm dev:mfe        # Example MFE on http://localhost:3001
```

### Testing the MFE Integration
1. Start both apps with `pnpm dev`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
3. Click on "Example MFE" in the navigation or go to http://localhost:3000/mfe/example
4. The example MFE will be dynamically loaded and you can test all the services

## Project Structure

### Root Level ✅
- ✅ pnpm workspace configuration (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`)
- ✅ Shared Vite, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript configs
- ✅ Monorepo package.json with scripts for parallel development
- ✅ Global dependencies and build tools

### Apps Directory ✅

#### Container App (`apps/container/`) ✅
- **Purpose**: Main shell application with navigation and MFE loading
- **Port**: 3000
- **Features**:
  - ✅ Top navigation bar with logo on left and nav items on right
  - ✅ React Router setup for routing between pages and MFEs
  - ✅ Redux store configuration with auth, modal, and notification slices
  - ✅ Layout component with navigation, modal, and notification systems
  - ✅ MFE loading page that uses the dev kit to render MFEs
  - ✅ ShadCN UI components (Button, Dialog, Toast)
  - ✅ Global exposure of React, ReactDOM, and Redux store

#### Example MFE (`apps/mfe-example/`) ✅
- **Purpose**: Demonstration microfrontend
- **Port**: 3001
- **Features**:
  - ✅ Builds as UMD module for dynamic loading
  - ✅ Uses shared React and Redux from container
  - ✅ Demonstrates service usage (modal, notifications, event bus)
  - ✅ Shows auth session integration
  - ✅ Interactive testing interface for all services
  - ✅ Development mode with mock services

### Packages Directory ✅

#### MFE Development Kit (`packages/mfe-dev-kit/`) ✅
**Services provided**:
- ✅ **Logger**: Console logging with different levels and prefixes
- ✅ **Auth Service**: Provides current user session and authentication state
- ✅ **Event Bus**: Publish/subscribe system for inter-MFE communication
- ✅ **Modal Service**: Function to trigger modals in container app
- ✅ **Notification Service**: Function to show notifications in container app

**Components provided**:
- ✅ **MFELoader**: React component that dynamically loads MFE scripts
- ✅ **MFERegistry**: Service to manage MFE manifests and loading
- ✅ **MFEPage**: Route component that loads MFEs based on URL parameters

**Types defined**:
- ✅ MFE manifest structure (name, version, URL, dependencies, shared libs)
- ✅ MFE registry format
- ✅ Auth session interface
- ✅ Event payload structure
- ✅ Modal and notification configuration interfaces
- ✅ Complete TypeScript definitions for all services

#### Shared Package (`packages/shared/`) ✅
- ✅ Common utilities and components used across apps
- ✅ TypeScript utility types
- ✅ Shared constants and configurations
- ✅ Helper functions (cn, delay, generateId)

## Key Configuration Status ✅

### Dependency Sharing ✅
- ✅ Container app exposes React, ReactDOM, Redux store globally
- ✅ MFEs configured to use external dependencies instead of bundling them
- ✅ Peer dependencies properly configured to avoid version conflicts

### Build Configuration ✅
- ✅ Container builds as standard SPA
- ✅ MFEs build as UMD modules with external dependencies
- ✅ Proper externalization of shared libraries in Vite configs

### Development Workflow ✅
- ✅ Parallel development scripts to run all apps simultaneously
- ✅ Individual development scripts for focused development
- ✅ Hot reload support for both container and MFEs

### TypeScript Configuration ✅
- ✅ Shared base TypeScript config (`tsconfig.base.json`)
- ✅ Path mapping for workspace packages
- ✅ Proper module resolution for monorepo structure

## Implementation Details ✅

### Navigation Structure ✅
Container app navigation includes:
- ✅ Home page (standard React component)
- ✅ Dashboard page (standard React component)  
- ✅ MFE routes (dynamic loading via `/mfe/:mfeName` pattern)

### MFE Loading Mechanism ✅
1. ✅ MFE registry contains manifest information for each MFE
2. ✅ Container dynamically creates script tags to load MFE bundles
3. ✅ MFEs expose themselves on global window object with predictable naming
4. ✅ Container provides services object on window for MFE consumption
5. ✅ Error handling for failed MFE loads with user-friendly fallbacks

### Service Integration ✅
- ✅ All MFEs receive the same services object containing logger, auth, event bus, modal trigger, and notification trigger
- ✅ Services are injected via global window object when MFE loads
- ✅ Redux store shared and accessible via window.__REDUX_STORE__

### Event Communication ✅
- ✅ Event bus allows MFEs to communicate with each other and container
- ✅ Events include type, payload data, timestamp, and source identification
- ✅ Container can listen to MFE events and vice versa

### Modal and Notification System ✅
- ✅ Container owns modal and notification rendering
- ✅ MFEs trigger modals/notifications via service functions
- ✅ Support for different modal sizes and notification types

## Development Scripts ✅
- ✅ `pnpm dev` - Start all apps in parallel
- ✅ `pnpm dev:container` - Start only container app
- ✅ `pnpm dev:mfe` - Start only example MFE
- ✅ `pnpm build` - Build all packages
- ✅ `pnpm type-check` - TypeScript checking

## ShadCN Integration ✅
- ✅ Initialize ShadCN in container app
- ✅ Add button, dialog, and toast components
- ✅ Configure proper Tailwind content paths for monorepo
- ✅ Ensure ShadCN components are shared but not bundled in MFEs

## Working Demonstration ✅
The implementation provides a complete working demonstration where:
1. ✅ Container app runs on port 3000 with navigation
2. ✅ Example MFE runs on port 3001 and builds as UMD
3. ✅ Navigation in container can route to MFE and load it dynamically
4. ✅ MFE can use container services (modal, notifications, event bus)
5. ✅ Shared dependencies work correctly without duplication
6. ✅ Development workflow allows simultaneous development of container and MFEs
