# Theme Service Implementation and State Demo Cleanup

## Overview

This PR implements a comprehensive theme management system as a dedicated container service, removing theme functionality from the Universal State Manager and cleaning up all state demo MFEs. It also adds support for multiple themes beyond just light/dark.

## Changes Summary

### 1. Theme Service Implementation

- **New Theme Service**: Created a dedicated `ThemeService` interface and implementation in the container
- **Container Integration**: Added theme service to the ContextBridge, making it available to all MFEs
- **Features**:
  - Theme persistence via localStorage
  - System theme preference detection
  - Real-time theme change subscriptions
  - Support for multiple themes (not just light/dark)

### 2. Multi-Theme Support

- **Flexible Theme Type**: Changed from `'light' | 'dark'` union to `string` type
- **Configurable Themes**: Support for any number of themes (e.g., light, dark, blue, sepia)
- **Enhanced API**:
  - `cycleTheme()`: Cycles through available themes
  - `getAvailableThemes()`: Returns list of supported themes
  - `configureThemeService()`: Configure themes before initialization

### 3. State Demo MFE Cleanup

- **Removed Theme from State Demos**: All three state demo MFEs (React, Vue, Vanilla) no longer manage theme
- **Fixed Vanilla Demo**: Resolved null reference errors and updated description
- **Updated Manifests**: Removed theme-related event listeners and features

### 4. Architecture Improvements

- **Clear Separation**: Theme is now properly a container UI concern, not application state
- **Simplified State**: Universal State Manager no longer includes UI preferences
- **Better Encapsulation**: All theme logic centralized in one service

## Technical Details

### Theme Service Interface
```typescript
export interface ThemeService {
  getTheme: () => Theme;
  setTheme: (theme: Theme) => void;
  subscribe: (callback: (theme: Theme) => void) => () => void;
  getAvailableThemes?: () => Theme[]; // Optional: List available themes
  cycleTheme?: () => void; // Optional: Cycle to next theme
}
```

### Usage Example
```typescript
// Basic usage
const theme = services.theme?.getTheme();
services.theme?.setTheme('dark');

// Subscribe to changes
const unsubscribe = services.theme?.subscribe((theme) => {
  console.log('Theme changed to:', theme);
});

// Multi-theme support
const themes = services.theme?.getAvailableThemes() || ['light', 'dark'];
services.theme?.cycleTheme(); // Cycles through available themes
```

## Files Changed

### Core Changes
- `packages/mfe-toolkit-core/src/types/index.ts` - Added ThemeService interface
- `apps/container-react/src/services/theme-service.ts` - New theme service implementation
- `apps/container-react/src/services/context-bridge.tsx` - Exposed theme service
- `apps/container-react/src/services/mfe-services.ts` - Integrated theme service
- `apps/container-react/src/components/Navigation.tsx` - Updated to use theme service

### State Demo Cleanup
- `apps/mfe-state-demo-react/src/App.tsx` - Removed theme functionality
- `apps/mfe-state-demo-vue/src/App.vue` - Removed theme functionality
- `apps/mfe-state-demo-vanilla/src/main.ts` - Removed theme functionality
- All state demo manifests updated

### Documentation
- `docs/architecture/state-management-architecture.md` - Updated with migration details
- `MULTI_THEME_SUPPORT.md` - Documentation for multi-theme implementation

## Benefits

1. **Architectural Clarity**: Theme management is now clearly a container responsibility
2. **Flexibility**: Support for unlimited themes, not just light/dark
3. **Performance**: No cross-tab sync overhead for theme changes
4. **Maintainability**: All theme logic in one place
5. **User Experience**: Respects system theme preferences

## Breaking Changes

- State demos no longer demonstrate theme switching (this is now a container concern)
- Any code relying on theme in universal state needs to use the theme service instead

## Testing

All functionality has been tested:
- ✅ Theme toggle in navigation works
- ✅ Theme preference persists across sessions
- ✅ State demos load without errors
- ✅ Multi-theme cycling works correctly
- ✅ All packages build successfully

## Migration Guide

For MFEs that need theme awareness:
```typescript
// Old way (removed)
const theme = stateManager.get('theme');

// New way
const theme = services.theme?.getTheme() || 'light';
services.theme?.subscribe((theme) => {
  // React to theme changes
});
```
