# Theme Service Migration

## Overview

This branch implements the theme management migration as recommended in the state management architecture documentation. Theme functionality has been moved from the Universal State Manager to a dedicated container service.

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Package Updates (`@mfe-toolkit/core`)
- Added `ThemeService` interface with methods:
  - `getTheme(): Theme` - Get current theme
  - `setTheme(theme: Theme): void` - Set theme explicitly
  - `toggleTheme(): void` - Toggle between light/dark
  - `subscribe(callback): unsubscribe` - Subscribe to theme changes
- Added `Theme` type (`'light' | 'dark'`)
- Extended `MFEServices` interface to include optional `theme` service

### 2. Container Implementation
- **New `theme-service.ts`**:
  - Implements `ThemeService` interface
  - Manages theme state with localStorage persistence
  - Respects system theme preference when no user preference exists
  - Applies theme by toggling `dark` class on document root
  - Updates meta theme-color for mobile browsers
  - Provides singleton instance via `getThemeService()`

- **Updated `context-bridge.tsx`**:
  - Added `getThemeService()` method to `ContextBridgeRef`
  - Exposes theme service to MFEs

- **Updated `mfe-services.ts`**:
  - Added `createThemeServiceImpl()` with proper error handling
  - Includes theme service in MFE services bundle

- **Updated `Navigation.tsx`**:
  - Now uses theme service instead of state manager
  - Simplified theme toggle implementation

### 3. State Demo MFEs Cleanup
Removed theme functionality from all state demo MFEs:

- **React State Demo**:
  - Removed theme state, toggle UI, and subscriptions
  - Removed theme card from UI layout

- **Vue State Demo**:
  - Removed theme state management via VueAdapter
  - Removed theme toggle component
  - Fixed template structure

- **Vanilla TypeScript Demo**:
  - Completely removed all theme-related code
  - Fixed null reference errors from non-existent DOM elements
  - Updated description to "Pure Vanilla TypeScript"

### 4. Manifest Updates
- Removed `app:theme-change` event listener from all state demo manifests
- Removed `theme-switcher` from features lists

### 5. Documentation Updates
- Updated state management architecture docs to mark theme migration as completed
- Added implementation details and benefits achieved

## Benefits

1. **Clearer Architecture**: Theme is now properly recognized as a container UI concern
2. **Simplified State**: Universal state no longer includes UI preferences
3. **Better Encapsulation**: Theme logic is centralized in one service
4. **Improved Performance**: No cross-tab sync overhead for theme changes
5. **System Integration**: Respects user's OS theme preference

## Testing

All packages build successfully and the theme service is working correctly:
- Theme toggle in navigation works
- Theme preference persists across sessions
- MFEs can access theme service if needed
- State demos no longer manage theme state

## Migration Path for Existing MFEs

MFEs that need theme awareness can now use:

```typescript
// In MFE component
const { services } = props;

// Get current theme
const currentTheme = services.theme?.getTheme() || 'light';

// Subscribe to changes
useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribe = services.theme?.subscribe((theme) => {
    // React to theme changes
  });
  return unsubscribe;
}, [services.theme]);
```

## Breaking Changes

- State demos no longer demonstrate theme switching (this is now a container concern)
- Any code relying on theme in universal state needs to use the theme service instead
