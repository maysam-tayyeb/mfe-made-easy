## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The MFE Made Easy platform implements a microfrontend architecture with:

- **Container Application** - React 19-based shell that orchestrates MFEs
- **Microfrontends** - Independently deployed frontend modules (React, Vue, Vanilla JS)
- **ContextBridge Services** - Container UI services (auth, modals, notifications)
- **Universal State Manager** - Cross-MFE application state with framework adapters
- **Dynamic Loading** - ES module imports without build-time coupling
- **Development Kit** - Tools, types, and components for building MFEs

## üîë Key Principles

1. **Independence** - MFEs can be developed and deployed independently
2. **Isolation** - MFEs are isolated from each other to prevent conflicts
3. **Communication** - Well-defined contracts for inter-MFE communication
4. **Performance** - Optimized loading and runtime performance
5. **Developer Experience** - Simple and efficient development workflow
