# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains architectural documentation for the MFE Made Easy platform.

## 🎯 Primary Document

### [Comprehensive Roadmap](./COMPREHENSIVE_ROADMAP.md)

**This is the main roadmap document** that consolidates all improvement tracking and future development plans. It includes:
- ✅ Completed improvements and achievements
- 🚧 In-progress work and current priorities
- 📅 Future development phases (Q1-Q4 2025 and beyond)
- 📊 Success metrics and technical targets
- 🚀 State management middleware roadmap
- 🔧 Framework adapter plans

## 📄 Core Architecture Documents

### [Architecture Decisions](./ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md)

Key architectural decisions and their rationale:

- Dynamic imports over Module Federation
- React Context over Redux
- Service injection pattern
- Dual state management approach
- MFE loader strategies

### [State Management Architecture](./STATE_MANAGEMENT_ARCHITECTURE.md)

Comprehensive guide to the dual state management system:

- ContextBridge for container services
- Universal State Manager for application state
- Clear separation of concerns
- Migration recommendations

### [MFE Loading Guide](./MFE_LOADING_GUIDE.md)

Technical guide for MFE loading implementation:

- Current dual-loader implementation
- When to use each loader
- Consolidation plan for unified loader
- Performance best practices

### [Universal State Abstraction](./UNIVERSAL_STATE_ABSTRACTION.md)

Design principles for vendor-agnostic state management:

- Abstraction layer benefits
- Migration capabilities
- Implementation flexibility
- Future-proofing strategies


## 📚 Reference Documents

### [Architecture Analysis Report](./architecture-analysis-report.md)

Original comprehensive analysis that informed the roadmap:

- Current implementation review
- Strengths and weaknesses analysis
- Improvement recommendations

Please use the Comprehensive Roadmap for all improvement tracking and planning.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The MFE Made Easy platform implements a microfrontend architecture with:

- **Container Application** - React 19-based shell that orchestrates MFEs
- **Microfrontends** - Independently deployed frontend modules (React, Vue, Vanilla JS)
- **ContextBridge Services** - Container UI services (auth, modals, notifications)
- **Universal State Manager** - Cross-MFE application state with framework adapters
- **Dynamic Loading** - ES module imports without build-time coupling
- **Development Kit** - Tools, types, and components for building MFEs

## 🔑 Key Principles

1. **Independence** - MFEs can be developed and deployed independently
2. **Isolation** - MFEs are isolated from each other to prevent conflicts
3. **Communication** - Well-defined contracts for inter-MFE communication
4. **Performance** - Optimized loading and runtime performance
5. **Developer Experience** - Simple and efficient development workflow
