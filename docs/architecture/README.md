## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The MFE Made Easy platform implements a microfrontend architecture with:

- **Container Application** - React 19-based shell that orchestrates MFEs
- **Microfrontends** - Independently deployed frontend modules
- **Shared Services** - Centralized auth, notifications, modals, event bus
- **Development Kit** - Tools and utilities for building MFEs

## 🔑 Key Principles

1. **Independence** - MFEs can be developed and deployed independently
2. **Isolation** - MFEs are isolated from each other to prevent conflicts
3. **Communication** - Well-defined contracts for inter-MFE communication
4. **Performance** - Optimized loading and runtime performance
5. **Developer Experience** - Simple and efficient development workflow
