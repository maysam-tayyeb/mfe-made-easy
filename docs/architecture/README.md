- Clear separation of concerns
- Migration recommendations

### [MFE Loading Guide](./mfe-loading-guide.md)

Technical guide for MFE loading implementation:

- Current dual-loader implementation
- When to use each loader
- Consolidation plan for unified loader
- Performance best practices

### [Universal State Abstraction](./universal-state-abstraction.md)

Design principles for vendor-agnostic state management:

- Abstraction layer benefits
- Migration capabilities
- Implementation flexibility
- Future-proofing strategies

### [MFE Manifest Specification](./mfe-manifest.md)

Comprehensive specification for MFE manifests:

- Type-safe manifest structure
- Dependency and compatibility management
- Service requirements and capabilities
- Rich metadata for UI display

## 📚 Reference Documents

### [Architecture Analysis Report](./architecture-analysis-report.md)

Original comprehensive analysis that informed the roadmap:

- Current implementation review
- Strengths and weaknesses analysis
- Improvement recommendations
- Success metrics

## ⚠️ Deprecated Documents

The following documents have been consolidated into the [Comprehensive Roadmap](./comprehensive-roadmap.md):

- **IMPROVEMENTS_STATUS.md** - Tracking of completed improvements (merged)

Please use the Comprehensive Roadmap for all improvement tracking and planning.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The MFE Made Easy platform implements a microfrontend architecture with:

- **Container Application** - Shell application that orchestrates MFEs
  - Top navigation bar with dropdown menus for optimal screen real estate
  - Compact, responsive layouts with max-width constraints
  - Design system components for consistent UI
- **Microfrontends** - Independently deployed frontend modules (React, Vue, Vanilla JS)
  - React 19 Event Bus demo with tabbed interface
  - Support for multiple MFE demos in single view
- **ContextBridge Services** - Container UI services (auth, modals, notifications)
- **Universal State Manager** - Cross-MFE application state with framework adapters
- **Dynamic Loading** - ES module imports without build-time coupling
- **Development Kit** - Tools, types, and components for building MFEs
- **Design System** - Reusable components (EventLog, Card, Grid, etc.)

## 🔑 Key Principles

1. **Independence** - MFEs can be developed and deployed independently
2. **Isolation** - MFEs are isolated from each other to prevent conflicts
3. **Communication** - Well-defined contracts for inter-MFE communication
4. **Performance** - Optimized loading and runtime performance
5. **Developer Experience** - Simple and efficient development workflow
