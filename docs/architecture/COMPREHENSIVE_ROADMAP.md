# MFE Toolkit - Comprehensive Roadmap

This document consolidates all improvement tracking and future development plans for the MFE Toolkit platform.

## 📊 Document Overview

This roadmap combines:
- **Completed Improvements** (from IMPROVEMENTS_STATUS.md)
- **7-Phase Development Plan** (from improvement-roadmap.md)  
- **State Management & Middleware Roadmap** (from FUTURE_ROADMAP.md)

---

## ✅ Completed Improvements (2025 Q1)

### Major Achievements

#### 1. **Global Window Pollution Elimination** ✅
**Completed**: 2025-08-05

- Removed all `window.__*__` assignments
- Implemented proper dependency injection via ContextBridge
- Services passed through component props/mount functions
- Improved security and testability

#### 2. **Typed Event Bus System** ✅
**Completed**: 2025-07-30

- Fully typed event bus with TypeScript generics
- Standard MFE event map (lifecycle, navigation, user, state events)
- Migration adapter for backward compatibility
- Event validation, interceptors, and async patterns
- Event statistics and monitoring

#### 3. **State Management Migration** ✅
**Completed**: 2025-01-30

- Migrated from Redux to React Context in container
- Implemented isolated state management per MFE
- Created Universal State Manager with vendor-agnostic abstraction
- Cross-tab synchronization and persistence
- Framework-agnostic (React, Vue, Vanilla JS)

#### 4. **Error Boundaries & Recovery** ✅
**Completed**: 2025-01-30

- MFEErrorBoundary with automatic retry (3 attempts)
- Exponential backoff for failed loads
- Comprehensive error reporting service
- Error throttling and session tracking
- Fixed MFE flickering with dual loader approach

#### 5. **Module Federation Decision** ❌
**Rejected**: Will not implement

- Chose Dynamic Imports for better independence
- No build-time coupling between MFEs
- Teams can use different tools and deploy independently

### Architecture Patterns Established

- **ContextBridge**: Container UI services (auth, modals, notifications)
- **Universal State Manager**: Cross-MFE application state
- **Service Injection**: No global pollution, better testability
- **Dual MFE Loaders**: Temporary solution for re-render issues

#### Next Sprint (Phase 1)

##### 1. @mfe-toolkit/state-middleware-devtools 🔍

**Overview:**
- Time-travel debugging
- State diff visualization
- Redux DevTools integration
- Action replay functionality

**GitHub Issue Template:**
```
Title: [Enhancement] Implement @mfe-toolkit/state-middleware-devtools - Time-travel debugging middleware
Labels: enhancement, middleware, devtools, phase-1, state-management

Description:
Create a comprehensive development tools middleware for the MFE Toolkit state management system that provides time-travel debugging and state inspection capabilities.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Create new package with proper package.json structure
- [ ] Implement time-travel debugging (undo/redo state changes)
- [ ] Add state diff visualization capabilities
- [ ] Build action replay functionality
- [ ] Include performance profiling for state operations
- [ ] Create state snapshots export/import feature
- [ ] Integrate with Redux DevTools Extension
- [ ] Provide TypeScript types and JSDoc comments
- [ ] Write unit tests with >80% coverage
- [ ] Create documentation with usage examples
- [ ] Ensure bundle size stays under 5KB gzipped
- [ ] Follow established middleware patterns
- [ ] Add integration tests with React, Vue, and Vanilla JS

Technical Notes:
- Must work across different MFE frameworks
- Should not impact production performance when disabled
- Provide both programmatic API and browser extension integration
- Handle large state objects efficiently
```

##### 2. @mfe-toolkit/state-middleware-validation ✅

**Overview:**
- Schema validation (Zod, Yup, custom)
- Type guards for state updates
- Development warnings
- Production-safe validation

**GitHub Issue Template:**
```
Title: [Enhancement] Implement @mfe-toolkit/state-middleware-validation - Runtime state validation middleware
Labels: enhancement, middleware, validation, phase-1, state-management, type-safety

Description:
Create a runtime state validation middleware that provides schema validation and type checking for state updates in the MFE Toolkit state management system.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Create new package with proper package.json structure
- [ ] Support multiple validation libraries (Zod, Yup, custom)
- [ ] Implement type guards for state updates
- [ ] Add development-time warnings for validation failures
- [ ] Ensure production-safe validation (configurable)
- [ ] Create schema validation for nested state objects
- [ ] Provide clear error messages with field-level details
- [ ] Support conditional validation based on state context
- [ ] Include TypeScript integration
- [ ] Write unit tests with >80% coverage
- [ ] Create documentation with usage examples
- [ ] Ensure bundle size stays under 5KB gzipped
- [ ] Follow established middleware patterns
- [ ] Provide performance benchmarks

Technical Notes:
- Allow selective validation (validate only specific state keys)
- Support async validation for remote schema validation
- Provide both strict mode (throw errors) and warning mode
- Handle circular references in complex state objects
- Integrate seamlessly with TypeScript

Example Usage:
const validationMiddleware = createValidationMiddleware({
  cart: z.object({
    items: z.array(cartItemSchema),
    total: z.number().min(0)
  }),
  user: userSchema
});
```
