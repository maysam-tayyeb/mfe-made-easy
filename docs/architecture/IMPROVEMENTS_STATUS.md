# Architecture Improvements Status

This document tracks the status of architecture improvements identified in the [Architecture Analysis Report](./architecture-analysis-report.md).

## Status Legend
- ✅ **Completed**
- 🚧 **In Progress**
- 📋 **Planned**
- ❌ **Blocked**

## Improvement Status

### 1. ✅ Global Window Pollution
**Status**: Completed (2025-01-30)
**Implementation**:
- Removed `window.__MFE_SERVICES__` assignment
- Removed `window.__EVENT_BUS__` assignment
- Removed `window.__REDUX_STORE__` assignment
- Implemented proper dependency injection via ContextBridge
- Services are now passed through component props/mount functions

### 2. 📋 MFE Loading Strategy
**Status**: Planned
**Next Steps**:
- Implement MFE manifest system
- Add version negotiation
- Create fallback mechanisms

### 3. 📋 Event Bus Architecture
**Status**: Planned
**Notes**: Event bus still uses basic implementation, typed events pending

### 4. ✅ State Management
**Status**: Completed (2025-01-30)
**Implementation**:
- Migrated from Redux to React Context in container
- Removed shared Redux store
- Implemented isolated state management
- Each MFE now manages its own state independently

**Known Issue**: React 17 MFE Zustand conflict (see [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](../../KNOWN_ISSUES.md))

### 5. 📋 Error Boundaries and Recovery
**Status**: Planned
**Next Steps**: Implement proper error boundaries for MFE isolation

### 6. 📋 Module Federation
**Status**: Planned
**Notes**: Currently using dynamic imports, Module Federation migration pending

### 7. 📋 Security Considerations
**Status**: Planned
**Next Steps**:
- Implement CSP headers
- Add MFE sandboxing
- Validate dynamic imports

## Completed Improvements Summary

### Phase 1 Achievements (2025-01-30)
1. **Eliminated Global Window Pollution**
   - Removed all global window assignments
   - Implemented proper dependency injection
   - Services now passed through secure channels

2. **Improved State Management Isolation**
   - Migrated from shared Redux to isolated React Context
   - Each MFE has independent state management
   - No more cross-MFE state pollution risks

### Benefits Realized
- ✅ Better security through elimination of global scope pollution
- ✅ Improved testability with proper dependency injection
- ✅ Enhanced MFE isolation and independence
- ✅ Cleaner architecture without global dependencies
- ✅ Reduced coupling between container and MFEs

### Technical Debt Addressed
- Removed 300+ lines of Redux boilerplate
- Simplified state management with React Context
- Reduced bundle size by removing Redux dependencies
- Improved type safety with TypeScript contexts
