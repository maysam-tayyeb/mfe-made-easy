# MFE Manifest V2 Implementation Progress

## Summary of Work Completed

### Phase 1: Individual Manifest Files (âœ… Completed)

Successfully created individual `manifest.json` files for all 6 MFEs in the monorepo:

1. **mfe-example** - Service Explorer MFE with React 19
2. **mfe-react17** - Legacy Service Explorer with React 17
3. **mfe-event-demo** - Event Bus demonstration
4. **mfe-state-demo-react** - Universal state demo (React)
5. **mfe-state-demo-vue** - Universal state demo (Vue)
6. **mfe-state-demo-vanilla** - Universal state demo (Vanilla JS)

Each manifest includes:
- V2 schema compliance
- Proper dependency declarations
- Service requirements
- Compatibility specifications
- Complete metadata

### Phase 2: Build-Time Validation (ðŸš§ In Progress - Reverted)

**Attempted Implementation:**
1. Created validation scripts:
   - `scripts/validate-manifest-in-build.ts` - For individual MFE builds
   - `scripts/validate-manifests.ts` - For validating all manifests
   - `scripts/validate-manifest-simple.ts` - Simplified version without imports

2. Created build plugins:
   - `packages/mfe-dev-kit/src/build/manifest-plugin.ts` - Vite/ESBuild plugin
   - `packages/mfe-dev-kit/src/build.ts` - Build tools entry point

3. Updated all MFE build scripts to include validation step

**Issues Encountered:**
- Module resolution errors when using `pnpm dlx tsx` with workspace packages
- TypeScript files being imported in Node.js context
- Complexity of integrating build plugins across different build systems

**Current Status:**
- Changes reverted per user request
- Individual manifest files remain in place
- Build scripts restored to original state
- Ready for alternative approach to build-time validation

## Next Steps

User indicated they want to implement something else first to simplify the build-time validation step. Potential simplifications could include:

1. **Centralized build tooling** - Standardize all MFEs to use the same build system
2. **Pre-compiled validation** - Build the validator as a standalone CLI tool
3. **Build-time code generation** - Generate manifests from package.json or TypeScript
4. **Simplified validation** - Use JSON schema validation without TypeScript dependencies

## Files Created (Still Present)

```
apps/mfe-example/manifest.json
apps/mfe-react17/manifest.json
apps/mfe-event-demo/manifest.json
apps/mfe-state-demo-react/manifest.json
apps/mfe-state-demo-vue/manifest.json
apps/mfe-state-demo-vanilla/manifest.json
scripts/build-registry.ts
docs/MFE_MANIFESTS.md
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Module Resolution**: Running scripts via `pnpm dlx` creates isolation that prevents access to workspace packages
2. **Build Tool Diversity**: Different MFEs use different build tools (Vite, ESBuild, both), making unified validation challenging
3. **TypeScript in Node**: Direct imports of `.ts` files in Node.js contexts require careful handling
4. **Validation Timing**: Build-time validation needs to be lightweight and dependency-free

## Recommendations

Before implementing build-time validation, consider:

1. **Standardize Build Tools**: Migrate all MFEs to use the same build system (either all Vite or all ESBuild)
2. **Pre-compile Validation**: Build the manifest validator as a standalone executable
3. **Simplify Dependencies**: Remove the need for importing from workspace packages during build
4. **Use JSON Schema**: Leverage standard JSON schema validation tools instead of custom TypeScript validators

This approach would make the build-time validation implementation much simpler and more reliable.
