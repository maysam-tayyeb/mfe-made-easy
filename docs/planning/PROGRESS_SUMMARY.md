- ✅ Documented Event Demo and State Demo MFEs
- ✅ Moved planning documents to `docs/planning/`
- ✅ Created consolidated transformation plan
- ✅ Removed 6 monolithic MFEs (~2000 lines of code)
- ✅ Updated MFE registry to remove deprecated entries

### 2. Design System Analysis
- ✅ Comprehensive UI pattern analysis across all pages
- ✅ Identified typography inconsistencies
- ✅ Documented spacing patterns
- ✅ Created design token specifications
- ✅ Listed components needing standardization

### 3. MFE Development Container Architecture
- ✅ Identified critical need for isolated MFE development
- ✅ Designed universal dev container architecture
- ✅ Created comprehensive architecture document
- ✅ Planned service tester UI panel
- ✅ Specified integration with build tools

### 4. Initial Implementation
- ✅ Created `@mfe-toolkit/dev-container` package structure
- ✅ Implemented HTML template with full UI
- ✅ Set up TypeScript configuration
- ✅ Designed responsive layout with service panels

## Current State 🚧

### In Progress
- Service tester UI panel implementation
- Core service implementations for dev container

### Package Structure Created
```
packages/mfe-toolkit-dev-container/
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── src/
    └── templates/
        └── index.html (Complete UI template)
```

## Next Steps 📋

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Complete Dev Container Core**
   - Implement Express dev server
   - Create service implementations (modal, notification, etc.)
   - Add MFE loader functionality
   - Implement WebSocket for real-time updates

2. **Service Implementations**
   - Modal service with UI rendering
   - Notification/toast service
   - Event bus with logging
   - Auth state mocking
   - Theme service

3. **CLI Integration**
   - Create CLI commands for dev container
   - Add to existing `@mfe-toolkit/cli` package
   - Support for `mfe-dev` command

### Next Week
1. **Test with Existing MFEs**
   - Use modal demo MFEs for testing
   - Ensure hot reload works
   - Verify service compatibility

2. **Create MFE Templates**
   - React 19 template with dev container
   - React 17 template
   - Vue 3 template
   - Vanilla TS template

3. **Documentation**
   - Usage guide for dev container
   - Migration guide for existing MFEs
   - Service API documentation

## Key Insights 💡

### Critical Discovery
Before creating more MFEs, we identified the need for a proper development environment. This will significantly improve developer experience and ensure consistency across all MFEs.

### Architecture Decision
Chose a universal dev container approach over framework-specific containers to:
- Reduce maintenance overhead
- Ensure consistency
- Simplify the development workflow

### Design System Findings
- Button heights inconsistent (h-9 vs h-10)
- Card padding varies (p-4 vs p-6)
- Typography scale needs standardization
- Grid gaps lack semantic naming

## Files Modified/Created

### Created
- `/docs/planning/CONSOLIDATED_PLAN.md`
- `/docs/planning/MFE_DEV_CONTAINER_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `/docs/planning/DESIGN_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md`
- `/docs/archive/SERVICE_EXPLORER_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- `/packages/mfe-toolkit-dev-container/` (new package)
- `/packages/design-system/src/tokens/index.ts`

### Removed
- `/apps/mfe-example/` (585 lines)
- `/apps/mfe-react17/` (500 lines)
- `/apps/mfe-event-demo/` (159 lines)
- `/apps/mfe-state-demo-react/` (153 lines)

### Modified
- `/apps/container-react/public/mfe-registry.json` (removed deprecated MFEs)
- `/docs/planning/design-system-plan.md` (moved from /docs/)

## Metrics 📊

- **Code Reduction**: ~2000 lines removed
- **Documentation Added**: ~2500 lines
- **New Infrastructure**: Dev container package initialized
- **Planning Documents**: 4 comprehensive plans created

## Blockers & Decisions Needed ❓

### Resolved
- ✅ Whether to create universal or framework-specific dev containers → Universal

### Pending Decisions
1. Should dev container be part of CLI or separate package?
2. Which build tool plugin to prioritize (Vite, esbuild, webpack)?
3. Should we use existing container services or reimplement lighter versions?

## Branch Information

- **Branch**: `feature/design-system-and-reorg`
- **Commits**: 3 major commits
- **Status**: Pushed to remote, ready for PR when complete

## Conclusion

Significant progress made in establishing the foundation for a more maintainable and developer-friendly MFE platform. The discovery of the need for a development container was crucial and will greatly improve the developer experience going forward.

The removal of monolithic MFEs and comprehensive documentation ensures we have a clean slate for implementing the new architecture with proper design system integration.
