```

## Implementation

```bash
# Check for staged changes
git diff --cached --quiet || echo "No staged changes"

# Format only staged files
STAGED_FILES=$(git diff --cached --name-only)
for file in $STAGED_FILES; do
    if [[ "$file" =~ \.(ts|tsx|js|jsx|json|css|md)$ ]]; then
        pnpm prettier --write "$file"
        git add "$file"
    fi
done

# Lint only staged TypeScript/JavaScript files
for file in $STAGED_FILES; do
    if [[ "$file" =~ \.(ts|tsx|js|jsx)$ ]]; then
        pnpm eslint "$file" --max-warnings 0
    fi
